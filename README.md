# Haberdash Frontend Carousel Demo

This project is a frontend implementation challenge completed as part of an internship application. The task was to replicate a Figma-based design into a fully functional, responsive webpage using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—with an emphasis on a smooth, looping product **carousel** and responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

## 🎨 Live Demo 

You can view the live demo of the carousel on [GitHub Pages](https://slowbro213.github.io/IntTest/).


## 📸 Features

- ✅ Responsive layout that adapts from large screens to mobile
- ✅ Custom-built infinite looping product carousel
- ✅ Carousel supports smooth transitions with cloned elements
- ✅ Fully styled with custom CSS (no frameworks)
- ✅ Mobile-first design considerations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS carousel logic)

## 📂 Project Structure
/
├── index.html # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css # All layout & responsive styling

## 📱 Responsiveness

The layout includes breakpoints for:

- Large desktops (1200px+)
- Tablets (768px–1199px)
- Mobile (up to 767px)

The carousel dynamically calculates slide widths to ensure correct behavior across all screen sizes.
